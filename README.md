# 🏔️ GlacierGuard – Smart Monitoring for Climate Risk

GlacierGuard is a prototype monitoring system that combines **IoT sensors, AI-driven predictions, and blockchain-secured data** to track glacier melting and assess climate risks.  
While physical deployment on glaciers requires government and institutional support, our system demonstrates how climate monitoring can be made **scalable, secure, and predictive** using simulated and referenced datasets.

## 📌 Problem Statement
Glaciers are melting at unprecedented rates due to **climate change**, leading to:

❌ Increased flood risks from glacier lake outbursts  
❌ Rising sea levels, threatening coastal populations  
❌ Freshwater scarcity impacting millions  
❌ High monitoring costs with limited transparency  

Traditional monitoring methods are expensive, fragmented, and prone to **data manipulation**, limiting their effectiveness in addressing these urgent global challenges.
